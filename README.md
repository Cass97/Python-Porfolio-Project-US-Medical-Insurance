# Python-Porfolio-Project-US-Medical-Insurance
Open-ended portfolio project to conclude Codecademy "Python Fundamentals for Data Science" modules.
I was provided with a CSV file and it was left to me as to what observations I wished to make and what relationships I wished to explore.
It is limited to Python skills only (no SQL, Pandas etc.), but it demonstrates my understanding of:
    - Reading CSV files
    - Loops
    - Booleans
    - Lists
    - Strings
    - Dictionaries
